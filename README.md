# linguistic_limbo

# Hi! This is my Python script for my "Linguistic Limbo" project, which is a personal data analysis project analyzing and visualizing linguistic diversity, endangered languages and language revitalization efforts across the world using publicly available Kaggle data. 

# This project was created over the span of 2 weeks using Python [pandas, NumPy, matplotlib], Microsoft Excel and Tableau, and the report was compiled on Notion. 

# If you'd like to check out the report, please do so here: https://hyper-governor-c79.notion.site/The-Linguistic-Limbo-An-Investigation-of-the-Active-Endangered-and-Extinct-Languages-of-the-World-16ead749ffa5817788fede2046551db2

# Thanks!
# Tom
